Project template issues encountered:
* Office and SharePoint > SharePoint solutions > all SP 2016 items (install SharePoint Foundation or SharePoint Server 16.0)
* Office and SharePoint > VSTO Add-ins > all "template" and "document" items (.NET Programmability Tools, more specifically PIAs, must be installed but can't get my ancient Office installer to modify anything)
* Cloud > Azure Resource Group (about project type: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/vs-azure-tools-resource-groups-deployment-projects-create-deploy) - VS templating error similar to https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/280/cant-create-a-new-blank-uwp-project.html (could try repairing Azure SDK later)
* Extensibility > C# Item Template, C# Project Template, VSIX Project ("The vstemplate file references the wizard class 'Microsoft.VSSDK.TemplateWizard.TemplateTemplateWizard', which does not exist in the assembly 'System.Design...'")

* Cross-Platform > Mobile App (Xamarin.Forms) > Master Detail > .NET Standard - not following naming convention because of a path too long error (
